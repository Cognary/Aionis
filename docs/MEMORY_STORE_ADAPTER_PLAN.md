# Memory Store Adapter Plan

Last updated: `2026-02-27`  
Status: `phase_p0_in_progress`

## Objective

Introduce a storage adapter boundary so Aionis can keep Postgres as reference backend while preparing for future embedded backends.

## Phase P0 Scope

In scope:

1. Add a `MemoryStore` interface for client/transaction lifecycle.
2. Add `PostgresMemoryStore` reference implementation.
3. Route API DB access through store methods with no behavior change.
4. Add env contract key for backend selection (currently `postgres` only).

Out of scope:

1. Changing schema/query semantics.
2. Introducing embedded backend runtime.
3. Rewriting memory recall/write data access contracts.

## Progress

Completed in this phase:

1. `src/store/memory-store.ts` added (`MemoryStore` + `PostgresMemoryStore` + factory).
2. `src/index.ts` switched from direct `withClient/withTx` calls to `store.withClient/withTx`.
3. `MEMORY_STORE_BACKEND=postgres` added to env schema and `.env.example`.
4. Health/config logs now expose `memory_store_backend`.

## Next Steps

1. Expand adapter interface from lifecycle-only to capability methods (`append_commit`, `vector_candidates`, `get_nodes`, `get_edges`).
2. Move core recall/write queries behind capability methods incrementally.
3. Add `embedded` experimental adapter behind explicit feature flag.
