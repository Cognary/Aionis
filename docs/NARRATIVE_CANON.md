# Aionis Narrative Canon

## Fixed Main Narrative

`Verifiable / Operable Memory Kernel`

Canonical sentence for website and README first screen:

`Aionis is a Verifiable / Operable Memory Kernel for agents.`

## Fixed Pillars

1. `Audit-first`: memory write path is source-of-record with commit lineage and replayability.
2. `Derived async`: embeddings, clustering, and stats are derived asynchronously; failures do not block core writes.
3. `Memory -> Policy`: memory becomes executable policy via rules, planner/tool selection, and feedback loop.

## Fixed Release Story Structure

Use this exact order in every release communication:

`Problem -> Architecture Principles -> Evidence -> Boundaries -> Next Step`

Reference template:

- [Release Narrative Template](./RELEASE_NARRATIVE_TEMPLATE.md)

Audience materials:

- [Technical Release Material](./RELEASE_MATERIAL_TECHNICAL.md)
- [Product Release Material](./RELEASE_MATERIAL_PRODUCT.md)
- [Business Release Material](./RELEASE_MATERIAL_BUSINESS.md)

## Messaging Guardrail

Avoid generic claim style like "memory is more accurate" as primary positioning.
Lead with verifiability, operability, and policy execution; then attach benchmark or latency data as evidence.
